# Read a text stream on standard input, and output a list of
# the n (default: 25) most frequently occurring words and
# their frequency counts, in order of descending counts, on
# standard output.

# Usage:
# wf [n]
tr -cs A-Za-z\' '\n' |                      #Replace nonletters with newlines
 tr A-Z a-z |                               #Map uppercase to lowercase
 sort |                                     #Sort the words in ascending order
 uniq -c |                                  #Eliminate duplicates, showing their counts
 sort -k1,1nr -k2 |                         #Sort by descending count, and then by ascending word
 sed ${1:-25}q                              #Print only the first n (default: 25) lines; see Chapter 3
